The `webapp` folder contains the **JSP (JavaServer Pages)** files that make up the front-end interface for the **User Access Management System**. These JSP files provide pages for user interactions, including login, signup, access request submissions, and admin functionalities. Each page dynamically displays data based on user roles (Employee, Manager, Admin), creating an interactive experience for accessing and managing software permissions within the organization.
