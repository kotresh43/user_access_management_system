# User Access Management System 

## Overview

The **User Access Management System** is a web-based platform designed to streamline and automate user access requests within an organization. It leverages **role-based access control (RBAC)**, offering distinct functionalities for three types of users:

- **Employee**: Can request access to various software applications.
- **Manager**: Can view, approve, or reject access requests submitted by employees.
- **Admin**: Has full control to manage software applications and user roles, ensuring secure access management across the system.

This project utilizes **Java Servlets**, **JSPs**, and **PostgreSQL** to handle backend processing, data storage, and user authentication. Deployed with **Apache Tomcat** as a web server and managed via **Maven**, it ensures a robust, scalable, and secure environment to handle user access efficiently.
